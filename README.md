The first individual assignment for the course Web Technology, 2016.

I followed a tutorial to get inspiration for basic styling and code, the source can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wCpkOk2uCg). I customized and expanded the HTML, CSS and Javascript to my liking. I added a page to the website to describe the goal of this small project.
